# 🚀 Git Workshop for Modern Software Engineers 🚀

The **Git Workshop for Modern Software Engineers** is an initiative by [Basti Ortiz](https://bastidood.github.io/) (@BastiDood) in partnership with the [UP Center for Student Innovations (UP CSI)][up-csi] and in cooperation with the [UP Association of Computer Science Majors (UP CURSOR)][cursor] and the [Association for Computing Machinery - UP Diliman Student Chapter, Inc. (UP ACM)][acm].

In this first installment (of possibly many more in a series of workshops on team collaboration and software engineering), we focused on the basics of the Git version control system, GitHub workflows, forks, pull requests, collaboration best practices, and repository security.

This workshop was co-presented by [Secuna Software Technologies][secuna], who hosted an introductory talk on security best practices with Git in today's ever connected world of cloud services in the open Internet.

> This event was held on **2023 November 29** from **6-8:30pm** at the Alumni Engineers Centennial Hall, University of the Philippines - Diliman.
